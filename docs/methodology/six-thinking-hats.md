# Six Thinking hats

The Six Thinking Hats, developed by Dr. Edward de Bobo, is a framework for brainstorming and decision-making that encourages you to explore different perspectives. It's like putting on different colored hats, each representing a specific mode of thinking.

- **White Hat(Neutral)**: This hat is all about *facts* and *figures*. When wearing it, you focus on gathering information, clarifying data, and presenting neutral viewpoints without judgment.

- **Red Hat(Emotional)**: Put on the re hat and let your emotions run wild! Explore your gut feelings, intuitions, and gut reactions to the situation. It's okay to be impulsive, passionate, and even pessimistic as long as you acknowledge these emotions without letting them dominate the discussion.

- **Black Hat(Critical)**: The black hat is the cautions voice, the devil's advocate. Anticipate potential problems, identify weaknesses, and explore worst-case scenarios. This critical thinking ensures you consider all the risks and potential pitfalls before moving forward.

- **Yellow Hat(Positive)**: Optimism reigns supreme under the yellow hat! Focus on the benefits, opportunities, and positive outcomes. Look for the silver linings, brainstorm possibilities, and highlight the potential value of the situation.

- **Green Hat(Creative)**: Let your imagination soar with the green hat! This is the time for fresh ideas, unconventional solutions, and playful experimentation. Break free from logic and embrace wild ideas, no judgment allowed.

- **Blue Hat(Organizer)**: Finally, the blue hat is the conductor of the thinking orchestra. It oversees the process, sets the agenda, and ensures everyone has a chance to contribute under the appropriate hats. The blue hat facilitates the discussion, making sure it stays focused and productive.
