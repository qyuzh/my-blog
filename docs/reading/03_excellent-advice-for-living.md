# Excellent Advice for Living

Don't measure your life with someone else's rule.

Listening well is a superpower. While listening to someone you love keep asking them "Is there more?" until there is no more.

Always demand a **deadline** because it weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. A deadline prevents you from trying to make it perfect so you have to make it different. Different is better.

Don't be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is to embarrassed to ask it.

Taking a break is not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength.

Gratitude will unlock all other virtues and is something you can get better at.

Treating a person to a meal never fails and is so easy to do. It's powerful with old friends and a great way to make friends.

Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.

Movement plus variety equals health.

A great way to understand yourself is to seriously reflect on everything you find irritating in others.

The advantage of a ridiculously ambitious goal is that it sets the bar very high so even if your effort falls short it may exceed an ordinary success.

When you give away 10% of your income you lose 10% of your purchasing power which is minor compared to the 110% increase in happiness you will gain.

The beat way to learn anything is to try to teach what you know.

Whenever you have a choice between being right or being kind, be king. No exceptions. Don't confuse kindness with weakness.

The best way to get to yes in a negotiation is to truly understand what yes means for the other party.

Recipe for greatness: Become just a teeny bit better than you were last year. Repeat every year.

Draw to discover what you see. Write to discover what you think.

Whenever you can't decide which path to take pick the one that produces change.

Habit is far more dependable than inspiration. Make progress by making habits. Don't focus on getting into shape. Focus on becoming the kind of person who never misses a workout.

If you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room. Hang out with, and learn from people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you.

You should demand extraordinary evidence in order to believe extraordinary claims.

Rule of 3 in conversation: To get to the real reason, ask a person to go deeper than what they just said. Then again, and then once more. The third time's answer is the one closest to the truth.

Pros make as many mistakes as amateurs; they've just learned how to gracefully recover from their mistakes.

Don't be the best. Be the only.

Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them; they are waiting for you to send an email; they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead.
