# Excellent Advice for Living

## Know Thyself

Always demand a *deadline* because it weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. A deadline prevents you from trying to make it perfect so you have to make it different. Different is better.

*Taking a break* is not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength.

Don't be afraid to *ask a question* that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is to embarrassed to ask it.

*Gratitude* will unlock all other virtues and is something you can get better at.

Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.

*Movement* plus variety equals health.

The advantage of a ridiculously ambitious goal is that it sets the bar very high so even if your effort falls short it may exceed an ordinary success.

A great way to understand yourself is to seriously reflect on everything you find irritating in others.

The beat way to learn anything is to try to teach what you know.

Whenever you have a choice between being right or being kind, be king. No exceptions. Don't confuse kindness with weakness.

The purpose of a *habit* is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth to flossing.

Don't be the best. Be the only.

Draw to discover what you see. Write to discover what you think.

Recipe for greatness: Become just a teeny bit better than you were last year. Repeat every year.

Expand your mind by thinking with your feet on a walk or with your hand in a notebook. Think outside your brain.

If you are not falling down occasionally you are just coasting.

## Link to other people

Don't measure your life with someone else's rule.

Listening well is a superpower. While listening to someone you love keep asking them "Is there more?" until there is no more.

Treating a person to a meal never fails and is so easy to do. It's powerful with old friends and a great way to make friends.

When you give away 10% of your income you lose 10% of your purchasing power which is minor compared to the 110% increase in happiness you will gain.

The best way to get to yes in a negotiation is to truly understand what yes means for the other party.

Whenever you can't decide which path to take pick the one that produces change.

Habit is far more dependable than inspiration. Make progress by making habits. Don't focus on getting into shape. Focus on becoming the kind of person who never misses a workout.

If you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room. Hang out with, and learn from people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you.

You should demand extraordinary evidence in order to believe extraordinary claims.

Rule of 3 in conversation: To get to the real reason, ask a person to go deeper than what they just said. Then again, and then once more. The third time's answer is the one closest to the truth.

Pros make as many mistakes as amateurs; they've just learned how to gracefully recover from their mistakes.

Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them; they are waiting for you to send an email; they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead.

The more you are interested in others the more interesting they'll find you. To be interesting, be interested.

Don't take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again later. It's amazing how often a second try works.

Promptness is a sign of respect.

When you are young, spend at least 6 months to 1 year living as cheaply as you can owning as little as you possibly can eating beans and rice in a tiny room or tent. That way any time you have to risk something in the future, you won't be afraid of the "worst-case" scenario.

Trust me: There is no "them".

Tend to the small things. More people are defeated by blisters than by mountains.

You lead by letting others know what you expect of them which may exceed what they themselves expect. Provide them a reputation that they can step up to.

If you ask for someone's feedback you'll get a critic. But if instead you ask for advice you'll get a partner.

The Golden Rule will never fail you. It is the foundation of all other virtues.

To make something good, just do it. To make something great, just redo it, redo it, redo it. The secret to making fine things is in remaking them.

This is true: It's hard to cheat an honest person.

"No" is an acceptable answer even without a reason.

## Thinking

Expand your mind by thinking with your feet on a walk or with your hand in a notebook. Think outside your brain.

Nothing elevates a person higher than taking responsibility for their mistakes. If you mess up, fess up. It's astounding how powerful this ownership is.

## Affair Management

Shorten your to-do list by asking yourself "What is the worst that will happen if this does not get done?" Eliminate all but the disasters.

## Others

To move through a place you may not be permitted, act like you belong there.

Hatred is a curse that does not affect the hated. It only poisons the hater. Release a grudge as if it were a poison.

You can obsess about your customers or you can obsess about beating the competition. Both work, but of the two obsessing about your customers will take you further.

Separate the processes of creating from improving. You can't write and edit or sculpt and polish or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don't select. While you sketch, don't inspect. While you write the first draft, don't reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgment.
